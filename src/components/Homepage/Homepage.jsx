      The Stroop effect is a psychological phenomenon that describes
      the delay in reaction between congruent and incongruent stimuli.
      <br />
      <br />
      This webapp will demonstrate the Stroop effect with a short series of tests that should show 
      the difference in reaction speeds depending on the congruency of words and colors.
      <br />
      <br />
      The first test will have matching colors and words.
      <br />
      The second test will have colors paired with random words.
      <br />
      The third test will have colors paired with random color words. 
      <br />
      <br />
      For example,
      <font color=" red"><b> RED </b></font>
      should be read as &quot;red&quot;,
      <font color=" yellow"><b> CAR </b></font>
      should be read as &quot;yellow&quot;, and
      <font color=" blue"><b> RED </b></font>
      should be read as &quot;blue&quot;.
      <br />
      <br />
      Click the &quot;get started&quot; button when you are ready.
      <br />
      Read the <b>color</b> of all 25 words out loud (or at least in your head) as quickly as you can. 
      <br />
      When you are finished, click the &quot;next&quot; button to continue to the next test.
      <br />
      <br />
      Note: you may need to resize your browser window to properly see the tests.
